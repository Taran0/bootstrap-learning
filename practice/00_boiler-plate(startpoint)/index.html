            But back then, the concept was revolutionary. The most connectivity so far experi‐
            enced by at-home modem users was dialing up and connecting to a bulletin board
            that was hosted by a single computer, where you could communicate and swap data
            only with other users of that service. Consequently, you needed to be a member of
            many bulletin board systems in order to effectively communicate electronically with
            your colleagues and friends.
            But Berners-Lee changed all that in one fell swoop, and by the mid-1990s, there were
            three major graphical web browsers competing for the attention of 5 million users. It
            soon became obvious, though, that something was missing. Yes, pages of text and
            graphics with hyperlinks to take you to other pages was a brilliant concept, but the
            results didn’t reflect the instantaneous potential of computers and the Internet to
            meet the particular needs of each user with dynamically changing content. Using the
            Web was a very dry and plain experience, even if we did now have scrolling text and
            animated GIFs!

            Shopping carts, search engines, and social networks have clearly altered how we use
            the Web. In this chapter, we’ll take a brief look at the various components that make
            up the Web, and the software that helps make it a rich and dynamic experience.
            It is necessary to start using some acronyms more or less right
            away. I have tried to clearly explain them before proceeding. But
            don’t worry too much about what they stand for or what these
            names mean, because the details will become clear as you read on.
